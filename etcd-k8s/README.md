# Etcd-test-composer

## Purpose

This repo demonstrates the use of the [Antithesis platform](https://antithesis.com/product/what_is_antithesis/) to test [etcd](https://etcd.io/). Follow the step-by-step tutorial [here](https://antithesis.com/docs/tutorials/)

## Setup

We use the public [etcd helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/etcd) to run a 3-node etcd cluster (`etcd0`, `etcd1`, `etcd2`).
