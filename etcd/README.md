# Etcd

## Overview

This repo demonstrates the use of the [Antithesis platform](https://antithesis.com/product/what_is_antithesis/) to test [etcd](https://etcd.io/). Follow the step-by-step tutorial [here](https://antithesis.com/docs/tutorials/etcd_docker/).

## Setup

6 containers are running in this system: 3 that make up an etcd cluster (`etcd0`, `etcd1`, `etcd2`), one `health-checker`, and two `client`. 

The `health-checker` container runs the `entrypoint.py` script which [signals that the system is ready for testing](https://antithesis.com/docs/tutorials/cluster-setup/#ready-signal). 

## Test Composer 

Antithesis' [Test Composer](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/) framework enables you to define a *test template,* a guide that the system uses to generate thousands of test cases that will run over a multitude of system states. When you use this framework, the platform will handle varying things like parallelism, test length, and command order. 

You provide a set of *test commands,* executables which the framework detects based on [their absolute directory location and names](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/first_test/#structuring-test-templates). 

In `client/Dockerfile.client`, you can see the test command get defined in the `client` container image: `/opt/antithesis/test/v1/main/parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py`.

*Drivers can be defined on any container in the system.* 

### Parallel Driver

`parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py` is a [parallel driver](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/test_composer_reference/#parallel-driver) that submits puts against the etcd cluster. 0 to many of these can run at once. It then validates that these puts were persisted in the database by connecting to another node and submitting get requests. 


## SDK Usage

This repository includes the use of Antithesis's Python SDK to do the following: 

### setupComplete

The ["setupComplete"](https://antithesis.com/docs/generated/sdk/python/antithesis/lifecycle.html#setup_complete) signals that the system is ready to test. For example, in `entrypoint.py`: 

`setup_complete({"Message":"ETCD cluster is healthy"})`

### Assertions

Antithesis SDKs allow users to [express the properties their software should have,](https://antithesis.com/docs/properties_assertions/) by [adding assertions to their code](https://antithesis.com/docs/properties_assertions/assertions/). We use 2 types of assertions in this example. 

#### Sometimes Assertions

[Sometimes assertions](https://antithesis.com/docs/properties_assertions/properties/#sometimes-properties) check that intended functionality *happens at least once in the course of testing* - in this case, that operations happen against the etcd cluster and that validation occurs. For example, in `parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py`: 

`sometimes(success, "Client can make successful put requests", {"error":error})`

#### Always Assertions

[Always assertions](https://antithesis.com/docs/properties_assertions/properties/#always-properties) check that something (like a guarantee) *always happens, on every execution history.* In this case, in `parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py` this line checks that the database key values stay consistent: 

`always(values_stay_consistent, "Database key values stay consistent", {"mismatch":mismatch})`

### Randomness

Randomness is key for autonomous testing, since we want the software to follow many unpredictable execution paths. [The Antithesis SDK](https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/sdk/#randomness) provides an easy interface to get structured random values while also providing valuable guidance to the Antithesis platform, which increases the efficiency of testing.

## Testing Locally

Before running your application on the Antithesis platform, checking your work locally before you kick off a full Antithesis test run can be convenient.

This process is [described in greater detail here](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/testing_locally/).

1. Pull the bitnamilegacy/etcd:3.5 image using the following command: 

`docker pull bitnamilegacy/etcd:3.5`

2. Build the health-checker image. From within the `health-checker` directory, run the following command:

`docker build . -f Dockerfile.health-checker -t etcd-tutorial-health-checker:tutorial`

2. Build the client image. From within the `/client` directory, run the following command: 

`docker build . -f Dockerfile.client -t etcd-tutorial-client:tutorial`

3. Run `docker-compose up` from the config directory to start all containers defined in `docker-compose.yml`

4. After the health-checker container has signaled `setupComplete` (or printed `cluster is healthy`), you can run the parallel driver 1 to many times via `docker exec`: 

`docker exec client1 /opt/antithesis/test/v1/main/parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py`

`docker exec client2 /opt/antithesis/test/v1/main/parallel_driver_generate_traffic.py`

6. Confirm that the parallel driver command works

You've now validated that your test is ready to run on the Antithesis platform! (Note that SDK assertions won't be evaluated locally.)

<!-- ## Example Report

Using the three node etcd cluster and the `client` image built from this repository, we ran a 1 hour test. The resulting [triage report](https://antithesis.com/docs/reports/triage/) can be found [here](https://public.antithesis.com/report/f6oh7KZ6Pchcv9nGfo5oL9IU/lCbpXJUfNwfknLazqvV3mWD3CM37l89raJTdSXNBh3c.html), and [our docs](https://antithesis.com/docs/reports/triage/) show you how to interpret it.  -->
